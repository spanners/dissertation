## Study Overview

This study aims to assess how Functional Reactive Programming Languages are used. To do this, we will be asking you to modify a Mario game to get him to fly. The session will take no more than 1 hour.

During the session, you will be introduced to Elm, a functional reactive programming language, as well as being shown what we want you to create. We’ll also present you with a questionnaire to see what experience you’ve had with Functional programming (or similar concepts) before. Finally we’ll give you another questionnaire to ask how you think the session went, and the level of workload in the task.

The session will be recorded on video and then the audio from the session will be transcribed anonymously in order to find any problems that you had during the session. During this process, the data will be stored securely.

# Post-Questionnaire

1. Please detail any comments on the result that you achieved

I am happy with my result.

2. Please detail any comments on how you achieved it

My first intention was to get myself familiarised with the language and its syntax and understand the basics of what the code was doing. After that I experimented with a few changes and succeeded in finishing the task.

3. Please detail any other comments

I think that the goal of the task could have been made more clear from the beginning, specifically what is meant by having the character fly and what should happen when you press the jumping button. Also, had to ask for the movement characters as they were not explained in the task description.

If you want to have the study as a whole explained to you, please do so now. However we ask that you refrain from discussing this with potential future participants.
