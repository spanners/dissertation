I want you to think about Human-Computer Interaction and Computer
Supported Collaborative Work. In principle, I am prepared to supervise
any student with research interests in these areas because I can offer
them expert advice. You may like to look at projects I have supervised
in previous years to get you thinking in more specific terms about what
you might do for a project.

#### Defining a project idea

Any student who would like me to supervise them must have taken CM20216
because it provides essential grounding for projects I would supervise.
You must start by doing some homework. Your project must be related to
contemporary developments in Human-Computer Interaction, and preferably
to the part of the HCI world that focuses on interactive systems for
collaboration.

To this end, students should first look at the HCI-related conference
proceedings in the ACM Digital Library to find a couple of papers that
reflect their interests. They should think about aspects of the papers
that seem promising and then contact me, referring to those papers, to
explain what they would like to research through their project work.
Follow the links below to find some papers:

-   [ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing
    Systems](http://libproxy.bath.ac.uk/login?qurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.acm.org%2Fevent.cfm%3Fid%3DRE151)
-   [ACM CSCW: Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative
    Work](http://libproxy.bath.ac.uk/login?qurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.acm.org%2Fevent.cfm%3Fid%3DRE169)
-   [ACM UIST: Symposium on User Interface Software and
    Technology](http://libproxy.bath.ac.uk/login?qurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.acm.org%2Fevent.cfm%3Fid%3DRE172)

The typical shape of any project I supervise is based on researching
some aspect of how people interact with software systems. It normally
starts with some user-centred research (observations, interviews, pilot
experiment) to ground the problem, carried out concurrently with
literature research. The research problem is normally boiled down to
something that can be addressed through the production of alternative
versions of an interactive system. This is closely followed by initial
design work and the production of a rough but working prototype leading
up to Christmas. After the January exams, my students typically re-scope
their research problem, based in the outcome of their initial work, and
solidify their implementation ready for a full evaluation in March and
April.

Students should prepare for their projects by refreshing their memories
about Interaction from CM20216 activities. You should read about HCI in
general, and support for collaboration in particular. Look at any or all
of the following book chapters:

-   Sharp, Rogers and Preece (2007) Interaction Design. Chapter 4:
    Designing to Support Communication and Collaboration.
-   Dix, Finlay, Abowd and Beale (2004) Human-Computer Interaction.
    Chapter 14: Communication and Collaboration Models.
-   Shneiderman and Plaisant (2005) Designing the User Interface.
    Chapter 10: Collaboration.

Specific Ideas
--------------

The three specific ideas listed below are just to give you an idea of
the sort of research you might do. Each project idea puts together a
form of human activity with an interactive technology that might support
its expression or execution. Â 

Support for multitasking among web collaborators
------------------------------------------------

Collaborators normally have more than one thing to do. They have to
plan, agree, log, and actually perform work. People who work in
co-located teams can tell when NOT to interrupt one another, and
sometimes when it makes sense for them to 'chip in' with an idea. Some
recent work in Human-Computer Interaction has focused on mechanisms to
support team members in timing their interruptions or contributions to
one anothers' tasks. This project would be to research, construct and
evaluate support for multitasking on the web. The 'support' could be in
the form of a stand-alone notification system, or an add-on to an
existing social networking or collaboration platform.

Dynamic abstract representation of computer users as they interact with their machine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project would involve researching principles and techniques for
visualizing user state. There are many ways of thinking about the value
of graphically representing user state. Perhaps the easiest is to think
of it in terms of stress. If people are made aware that they are getting
stressed, and in consequence that their decision-making ability is
compromised, they may be prompted to take a remedial action. You would
build a system that incorporates dynamic visualizations of its users,
and carrying out user evaluations of your system. You would choose data
sources to feed your representation (for example, rate and regularity of
keystroke depression). You would be thinking about state as a more
generalized notion of user activity level.This project could be extended
to generate multiple representations of users as they interact with one
another through their computers. It could also be developed towards
visualizing a group of users (one representation for multiple people).

A transcript analysis tool for multiple coding systems
------------------------------------------------------

Language is a very rich resource for all kinds of investigation. The
things people say matter. However, detailed analysis of transcripts is
difficult and very time consuming. Typically, analysts work with a
pre-defined set of codes for statements of different kinds. For example,
they might be interested in how people reach agreement in a meeting and
have codes like QUESTION, CLARIFY, CONTRADICT, AGREE, POSTPONE. They
work through a transcript, coding as they go, then examine the set of
codes for patterns and regularities, along with basic data (number of
words in a statement, number of statements, mean duration of speech), to
help answer their questions. This project would be to research, design,
construct and evaluate such a system.
