    abstract = {We describe a new architecture for controlling
                mobile robots. Layers of control system are built to
                let the robot operate at increasing levels of
                competence. Layers are made up of asynchronous
                modules which communicate over low bandwidth
                channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly
                simple computational machine. Higher level layers
                can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing
                their outputs. However, lower levels continue to
                function as higher levels are added. The result is a
                robust and flexible robot control system. The system
                is intended to control a robot that wanders the
                office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its
                surroundings. In this paper we demonstrate the
                system controlling a detailed simulation of the
                robot.},
