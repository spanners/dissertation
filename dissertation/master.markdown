# Group meeting with Leon at East Building, 11:15 Friday 4th October 2013


**N.B. READ UP ON AND REMIND YOURSELF OF HCI STUFF (Year 2) AND SOFTWARE
ENGINEERING STUFF (Year 1)**

### Reading material

In email repsonse to request for FYP meeting, **Leon writes:**

*Please do a bit of reading around beforehand. Go to the ACM Digital Library and
search on 'user interface programming'.*

1. [ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing
   Systems](http://libproxy.bath.ac.uk/login?qurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.acm.org%2Fevent.cfm%3Fid%3DRE151)
2. [ACM CSCW: Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative
   Work](http://libproxy.bath.ac.uk/login?qurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.acm.org%2Fevent.cfm%3Fid%3DRE169)
3. [ACM UIST: Symposium on User Interface Software and
   Technology](http://libproxy.bath.ac.uk/login?qurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.acm.org%2Fevent.cfm%3Fid%3DRE172)


In moodle project page, **Leon writes:**


*Your project must be related to contemporary developments in Human-Computer
Interaction, and preferably to the part of the HCI world that focuses on
interactive systems for collaboration*

1. ???
2. ???

Also In moodle project page, **Leon also writes:**

*It normally starts with some user-centred research (observations, interviews,
pilot experiment) to ground the problem, carried out concurrently with
literature research. 

The research problem is normally boiled down to something that can be addressed
through the production of alternative versions of an interactive system. 

This is closely followed by initial design work and the production of a rough
but working prototype leading up to Christmas. 

After the January exams, my students typically re-scope their research problem,
based in the outcome of their initial work, and solidify their implementation
ready for a full evaluation in March and April.*

Thus, my answers to the questions Leon posed should follow this structure in
terms of what I want to get out of it. I can use the above structure to identify
**concerns** of potential challenges in each step/combination of
steps/step-transitions (e.g. step dependencies, resource procurement)


Also in moodle product page, **Leon also writes:**

*Students should prepare for their projects by refreshing their memories about
Interaction from CM20216 activities. You should read about HCI in general, and
support for collaboration in particular. Look at any or all of the following
book chapters:*

* Sharp, Rogers and Preece (2007) Interaction Design. hapter 4: Designing to
  Support Communication and Collaboration.
* Dix, Finlay, Abowd and Beale (2004) Human-Computer Interaction. hapter 14:
  Communication and Collaboration Models.
* Shneiderman and Plaisant (2005) Designing the User Interface. hapter 10:
  Collaboration.

### Leon asked us to answer these questions and bring a notebook:

#### Q1. What I hope to get out of my FYP as an experience?

I hope to gain a deep and meaningful understanding of the programmer as a user,
as an individual and the context of that individual -- e.g. in a software team
inside a department, inside a management structure... inside a company.

I hope to use this understanding to determine processes/work-flows that
programmers experience in the endeavour of User Interface Design, both from the
individual perspective and as a team.

Within these work flows, I wish to identify, in detail, metrics to gauge
productivity, in order to measure this in experiments, perhaps doing A/B testing
with Elm and some other, perhaps procedural language. This is an example of an
objective measure. 

I would also like to gather self-reported, more "fuzzy" feedback on user's
perception of their productivity -- pain points, advantages, etc.  they
experience in using Language X to product a UI compared to Language Y
(Declarative languages like Elm, etc)

I wish to verify, empirically, the comparisons and claims made on the [http://elm-lang.org/learn/What-is-FRP.elm]() page of the elm-lang.org
website, and those claimed it's research paper (detailing the implementation of
Elm, **benefits**, etc.)

In email again, **Leon writes:**

*The Elm site makes **comparative statements.** That is encouraging because it
sets up opportunities for you to test some of the claims they make, and to ask
new questions about Elm that its proponents may not have considered.*

These are:

1. "most current frameworks for graphical user interfaces are not declarative.
   They mire programmers in the many small, nonessential details of handling
   user input and manually modifying the display."
2. "with FRP, many of the irrelevant details are left to the compiler, freeing
   the programmer to think about things that matter."
3. "Coding the examples on [http://elm-lang.org/Examples.elm]() in a traditional
   GUI framework such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript . would require significantly more
   work and headache."
4. "Not only is that painful to code, but it also requires broad and deep
   knowledge of inconsequential things."
5. "FRP makes tasks considerably easier by taking care of the messy .how. of
   events, display, and updates."

#### Q2. Where my Project Idea came from (what inspired me)?

* The pain of coding and writing GUIs in PyQt4 while at my last job at Altran
* The joys of coding in Haskell
* The pain of writing GUIs in Haskell
* The joys of coding and writing GUIs in Elm!

#### Q3. What are my concerns?

1. Difficulty procuring programmers (users) -- specifically those that meet my
   criteria of not having used a declarative programming language.
2. Difficulty procuring programmers working in a team
3. The complexity/scope of the project -- is it enough for a FYP; is it too
   much?
4. Looking at the production of User Interfaces using a programming language,
   there are many variables -- how will I devise an experiment to minimise this
   and isolate a variable so that I can make some causal/correlational
   conclusions?
5. Concern regarding the dependency of a subsequent part of the project on a
   previous step -- this is inherent of all projects, though.
