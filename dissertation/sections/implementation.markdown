# Implementation

Describe how I extended the Elm IDE

**This is the chapter in which you review the implementation and testing
decisions and issues, and critique these processes.  Code can be output inline
using ````some code````. For example, this code is inline: ````public static int
example = 0;```` (I have used the character | as a delimiter, but any
non-reserved character not in the code text can be used.) Code snippets can be
output using the environment with the code given in the environment. For
example, consider listing 5.1, below.  Listing 5.1: Example code

Code listings are produced using the package "Listings". This has many useful
options, so have a look at the package documentation for further ideas.**
