# Pilot Study 1

Using a per-participant questionnaire (See \ref{questionnaire1}), I captured video
& audio data of 2 participants while they completed the task of extending a
mario game to make mario fly. This initial pilot study was done to get a feel of
what behaviours may be worth investigating further while a user completes a
programming task.  I may then refine the methodology to enable said behaviours
to be isolated more effectively, varying some dependent variable to see if it
has any effect. I have one hypothesis based on my understanding of thrashing
from the literature review, [@Lopez2012a].

## Hypotheses

* **H1.** Novice users (*defined as*: those that list themselves as being new to
  functional programming in the pre-questionnaire)
  will press compile at least once every 2 minutes during the programming task.
* **H2.** Novice users will not pause (*defined as:* no mouse movement, no
  typing) for more than 2 minutes during the programming task.

### Method

1. Consent form is signed (See \ref{questionnaire1})
2. Pre-questionnaire is given out.
3. User is informed that they may ask for help, and that they will
   be prompted if they pause (at the moment they break the pause), to ask why they
   paused. They are also informed that they can end at any time, and the goal is
   to make mario fly.
4. User is shown the result of completed task (mario flying).
4. Programming task is begun.
5. User completes or ends the task.
6. Post-questionnaire is given out (See \ref{questionnaire1})
7. De-breifing.
8. Study ends.

Using Thematic analysis [@Braun2006Thematic] to code the captured audio and
video data, I will transcribe the programming activity, to see what themes
arise. 

The Scientific Method
=====================

1.  Define a question
2.  Gather information and resources (observe)
3.  Form an explanatory hypothesis
4.  Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data
    in a reproducible manner
5.  Analyze the data
6.  Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting
    point for new hypothesis
7.  Publish results
8.  Retest (frequently done by other scientists)

Using Thematic Analysis in Psychology
=====================================

In doing Thematic Analysis [TA], as a researcher, one must make **explicit** the
particular variant of TA that you intend to carry out, and the whole analysis
must be framed from that point on by that experimental methodology.

One must make the statement along the lines of: "Amongst the number of different
branches that the paper talks about, *X* with *Y* themes and *Z* focus is the
flavour of thematic analysis that I am going to use" -- e.g. essentialism NOT
constructionism, one aspect NOT whole, theoretical NOT inductive...

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Phase                       Description of the process
  --------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  1. Familiarising yourself   Transcribing data (if necessary), reading
  with your data:             and re-reading the data, noting down
                              initial ideas

  2. Generating initial       Coding interesting features of the data in
  codes:                      a systematic fashion across the entire
                              data set, collating data relevant to each
                              code.

  3. Searching for themes:    Collating codes into potential themes,
                              gathering all data relevant to each
                              potential theme.

  4. Reviewing themes:        Checking in the themes work in relation to
                              the coded extracts (Level 1) and the
                              entire data set (Level 2), generating a
                              thematic 'map' of the analysis.

  5. Defining and naming      Ongoing analysis to refine the specifics
  themes:                     of each theme, and the overall story the
                              analysis tells; generating clear
                              definitions and names for each theme.

  6. Producing the report:    The final opportunity for analysis.
                              Selection of vivid, compelling extract
                              examples, final analysis of selected
                              extracts, relating back of the analysis to
                              the research question and literature,
                              producing a scholarly report of the
                              analysis.

  Transcription    1      The data have been transcribed to an appropriate
                          level of detail, and the transcripts have been
                          checked against the tapes for 'accuracy'.

  Coding           2      Each data item has been given equal attention in
                          the coding process.

  ---              3      Themes have not been generated from a vew vivid
                          examples (an anecdotal approach), but instead
                          the coding process has been thorough, inclusive,
                          and comprehensive.

  ---              4      All relevant extracts for all each theme have
                          been collated.

  ---              5      Themes have been checked against eachother and
                          back to the original data set.

  ---              6      Themes are internally coherent, consistent, and
                          distinctive.

  Analysis         7      Data have been analysed -- interpreted, made
                          sense of -- rather than just paraphrased or
                          described.

  ---              8      Analysis and data match each other -- the
                          extracts illustrate the analytic claims.

  ---              9      Analysis tells a convincing and well-organised
                          story about the data and topic.

  ---              10     A good balance between analytic narrative and
                          illustrative extracts is provided.

  Overall          11     Enough time has been allocated to complete all
                          phases of the analysis adequately, without
                          rushing a phase or giving it a
                          once-over-lightly.

  Written report   12     The assumptions about, and specific approach to,
                          thematic analysis are clearly explicated.

  ---              13     There is a good fit between what you claim to
                          do, and what you show you have done -- i.e.,
                          described method and reported analysis are
                          consistent.

  ---              14     The language and concepts used in the report are
                          consistent with the epistemological position of
                          the analysis.

  ---              15     The researcher is positioned as *active* in the
                          research process; themes do not just 'emerge'.

  2005).



## Results

* **H1.** This happened
* **H2.** This happened

### Observation 1

* Prompting *"What are you thinking about?"* etc. seemed to place additional
  cognitive load on the user as they spent longer resuming than when not
  prompted. This caused noise in assessing the actual cognitive load incurred
  during the completion of the **task**. Were the signs of struggling/undergoing
  difficulty due to simply not understanding the language, or were they due to
  the difficulty of the task?

* In particular, the majority of instances where the users paused turned out to
  be confusion as to the semantics & syntax of the language.

### Model Adjustment 1

* Add tooltips that appear as the user places the keyboard cursor to the right
  of a token in the language.

### Observation 2

* Sifting through 1-hour+ of video data capture for incidences of cognitive load
  is *HARD!*. Is there some programmatic way of narrowing the video data to
  points of interest?

### Model Adjustment 2

* Track the user mouse and keyboard movements in a 3-tuple: `(Time t, (Mouse.x,
  Mouse.y), Keypress k)`
  
* It doesn't have to be implemented this way. I could extend **Model Adjustment
  1** to define blocks of code as tokens in themselves, and capture how long the
  cursor is static on that particular token.

* Leon suggested a further refinement of this idea in order to further narrow
  the data (in fact, just capturing mouse & keyboard movements will result in an
  explosion of the volume of data -- countrary to what I intend to achieve). His
  refinement was to define regions of interest in the code pane, and *only when
  the mouse/key cursor is in the region, do I capture data*. 

* Use the `if cursor in region then log (Time t, (Mouse.x, Mouse.y), Keypress
  k)` functionality as a *lens* to focus on significant portions of video
  capture.

## Further discussion

We then discussed some questions that might lead my direction of study in the
next steps of my research:

* Is the mouse/cursor position a proxy for someone's attention as they carry out
  the task?

* Often when I'm coding I'll leave the cursor where it is but think about other
  regions of code. I don't necessarily move the keyboard/mouse cursor to the
  section of code I'm thinking about. Instead, I use it as a 'bookmark' to track
  what I'm currently implementing, and may scroll around to other parts.

### We also discussed...

The result of the dissertation will be a list of observed cognitive
easing/loading that each language produces for users, much like an
advantage/disadvantage comparison:

----------- ------------
Elm         JavaScript
----------- ------------
+ ...       + ...

+ ...       - ...

- ...       - ...

- ...       + ...

----------- ------------


## Actions

1. Design a task in JavaScript to go inside this adjusted model
   (incorporating Model Adjustment 1 and 2).

     This will require a degree of *"implementation juggling"* in order to find a
     balance of code-length/difficulty over the same task in Elm in such a way
     that is not creating noise in the thing being studied: Cognitive load. 

     Keep the reactivity constant, compare the differences in ease between JS and
     Elm.

2. If time available, run another Pilot study on this task + adjusted model

### Modifications to be made to the experimental methodology

Needs to be more objective! Why? What will I modify?

# New Study! First, implement an IDE that logs input

## Requirements

I will now identify what the requirements are for the project.

### Functional Requirements

1.  Write software to assist the capture of objective data to inform me
    of the user’s activities as they use the Elm IDE.

    1.  The program must be able to work offline and later transfer
        collected data to me once a connection is resumed, collecting
        mouse and keyboard activity\
        **Priority: High**

2.  Perform Pilot and User Studies

    1.  I must perform Pilot and User Studies in an iterative fashion,
        each one learning and building upon discoveries made in prior
        ones, starting vague and getting more and more focused on a
        particular facet of User Interface Design and/or Declarative
        programming as an activity.\
        **Priority: High**

    2.  I must use these studies to inform experimental and software
        design to disambiguate and filter data collected in the
        experiment, and to exercise hypotheses.\
        **Priority: High**

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Source code

    1.  The software must be written clearly and simply.\
        **Priority: High**

    2.  The software must have suitable, concise comments which explain
        the programs intent, but only where the code alone is not
        enough.\
        **Priority: High**

2.  Activity recording

    1.  The program activity recording feature must not slow down the
        user’s use of the IDE more than 1ms difference than without it.\
        **Priority: High**

    2.  There should be software to visualise the usage data\
        **Priority: Medium**
