  This dissertation provides a browser-based Integrated Development Environment
  [IDE] that logs input device data for the purpose of performing user
  participation studies, whose implementation is described herein. The IDE is
  then used to conduct a study comparing the cognitive load experienced with two
  languages, Elm and JavaScript, during the completion of a basic task: to
  modify given source code in order to restrict the movement of a 2--D box from
  leaving the bounds of a frame. In order to do this comparison, the metric of
  `number of mouse clicks per code region` is selected, as an operationalisation
  of the concept of *thrashing* [@Lopez2012a], as being indicative of cognitive
  load during task completion. The study found that there is indeed statistical
  significance in the differences between clicks per code region, and presents
  suggestions for improvements and further work.
