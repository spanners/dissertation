  This dissertation provides a browser-based Integrated Development Environment
  [IDE] that logs input device data --- for the purpose of performing user
  participation studies --- whose implementation is described herein. The IDE is
  then used to conduct studies comparing the cognitive load
  experienced with two languages, Elm and JavaScript, during the completion of a
  basic task: modifying code to restrict the movement of a 2--D box from leaving
  the bounds of a frame. In order to do this comparison, the metric of `number
  of mouse clicks per code region` is selected, as an operationalisation
  of the concept of *thrashing* [@Lopez2012a], as being indicative of cognitive
  load during task completion.  **The study found...**
