## Pilot Study 1

### Consent Form \label{consent-form}

#### Study Overview

This study aims to assess how Functional Reactive Programming Languages are used. To do this, we will be asking you to modify a Mario game to get him to fly. The session will take no more than 1 hour.

During the session, you will be introduced to Elm, a functional reactive programming language, as well as being shown what we want you to create. We’ll also present you with a questionnaire to see what experience you’ve had with Functional programming (or similar concepts) before. Finally we’ll give you another questionnaire to ask how you think the session went, and the level of workload in the task.

The session will be recorded on video and then the audio from the session will be transcribed anonymously in order to find any problems that you had during the session. During this process, the data will be stored securely.
Important Information

All data collected during this study will be recorded such that your individual results are anonymous and cannot be traced back to you. 
Your results will not be passed to any third party and are not being collected for commercial reasons.
Participation in this study does not involve physical or mental risks outside of those encountered in everyday life.
All procedures and information can be taken at face value and no deception is involved.
You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and to have any data about you destroyed. If you do decide to withdraw, please inform the experimenter. 

By signing this form you acknowledge that you have read the information given above and understand the terms and conditions of this study.

    * **My first intention was to get myself familiarised with the language and its syntax and understand the basics of what the code was doing. After that I experimented with a few changes and succeeded in finishing the task.**
3. Please detail any other comments
    * **I think that the goal of the task could have been made more clear from the beginning, specifically what is meant by having the character fly and what should happen when you press the jumping button. Also, had to ask for the movement characters as they were not explained in the task description.**

## Pilot Study 2

### SPSS Multiple Regression \label{multiple-regression}

**N.B** languages (Lan) and the relevance (Rel) and difficulty (Diff)
are set to variables in the output: `Elm := 1.00`,  `JS := 2.00`, and later in
the *K-Way and Higher Order Effects* tables, `Rel := 1`, `Diff := 2`, `Lan :=
3`
