Discussed progress made and what hypotheses to form that may usefully model
cognitive load.

## Progress since last meeting

![Extensions made to the Elm IDE]

## Meeting Discussion

2 Hypotheses

1. Why the regions I define in the code (to mouse-track e.g.) are meaningful

2. Frequency of semantically or syntactically incorrect errors made will differ
   as a function of the language under study

These need narrowing as they are too broad to test. Explode them into multiple,
tighter hypotheses.

They are *valid* because they are *well-founded* -- i.e. I have good reason to
believe that # of errors made is an indication of cognitive load. I have good
reason to believe that the selected regions will have more mouse activity
(or whatever activity I suspect indicates higher cognitive load) as they are
harder regions of code OR they pertain to achieving the set task.
