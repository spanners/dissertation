The Scientific Method
=====================

1.  Define a question
2.  Gather information and resources (observe)
3.  Form an explanatory hypothesis
4.  Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data
    in a reproducible manner
5.  Analyze the data
6.  Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting
    point for new hypothesis
7.  Publish results
8.  Retest (frequently done by other scientists)

Using Thematic Analysis in Psychology
=====================================

In doing Thematic Analysis [TA], as a researcher, one must make **explicit** the
particular variant of TA that you intend to carry out, and the whole analysis
must be framed from that point on by that experimental methodology.

One must make the statement along the lines of: "Amongst the number of different
branches that the paper talks about, *X* with *Y* themes and *Z* focus is the
flavour of thematic analysis that I am going to use" -- e.g. essentialism NOT
constructionism, one aspect NOT whole, theoretical NOT inductive...

  Phase                       Description of the process
  --------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  1. Familiarising yourself   Transcribing data (if necessary), reading
  with your data:             and re-reading the data, noting down
                              initial ideas

  2. Generating initial       Coding interesting features of the data in
  codes:                      a systematic fashion across the entire
                              data set, collating data relevant to each
                              code.

  3. Searching for themes:    Collating codes into potential themes,
                              gathering all data relevant to each
                              potential theme.

  4. Reviewing themes:        Checking in the themes work in relation to
                              the coded extracts (Level 1) and the
                              entire data set (Level 2), generating a
                              thematic 'map' of the analysis.

  5. Defining and naming      Ongoing analysis to refine the specifics
  themes:                     of each theme, and the overall story the
                              analysis tells; generating clear
                              definitions and names for each theme.

  6. Producing the report:    The final opportunity for analysis.
                              Selection of vivid, compelling extract
                              examples, final analysis of selected
                              extracts, relating back of the analysis to
                              the research question and literature,
                              producing a scholarly report of the
                              analysis.

  : Phases of Thematic Analysis

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Process          No.    Criteria
  ---------------- ------ ------------------------------------------------
  Transcription    1      The data have been transcribed to an appropriate
                          level of detail, and the transcripts have been
                          checked against the tapes for 'accuracy'.

  Coding           2      Each data item has been given equal attention in
                          the coding process.

  ---              3      Themes have not been generated from a vew vivid
                          examples (an anecdotal approach), but instead
                          the coding process has been thorough, inclusive,
                          and comprehensive.

  ---              4      All relevant extracts for all each theme have
                          been collated.

  ---              5      Themes have been checked against eachother and
                          back to the original data set.

  ---              6      Themes are internally coherent, consistent, and
                          distinctive.

  Analysis         7      Data have been analysed -- interpreted, made
                          sense of -- rather than just paraphrased or
                          described.

  ---              8      Analysis and data match each other -- the
                          extracts illustrate the analytic claims.

  ---              9      Analysis tells a convincing and well-organised
                          story about the data and topic.

  ---              10     A good balance between analytic narrative and
                          illustrative extracts is provided.

  Overall          11     Enough time has been allocated to complete all
                          phases of the analysis adequately, without
                          rushing a phase or giving it a
                          once-over-lightly.

  Written report   12     The assumptions about, and specific approach to,
                          thematic analysis are clearly explicated.

  ---              13     There is a good fit between what you claim to
                          do, and what you show you have done -- i.e.,
                          described method and reported analysis are
                          consistent.

  ---              14     The language and concepts used in the report are
                          consistent with the epistemological position of
                          the analysis.

  ---              15     The researcher is positioned as *active* in the
                          research process; themes do not just 'emerge'.

  Flexibility.

  Relatively easy and quick method to learn, and do.

  Accessible to researchers with little or no experience of qualitative
  research.

  Results are generally accessible to educated general public.

  Useful method for working within participatory research paradigm, with
  participants as collaborators.

  Can usefully summarise key features of a large body of data, and/or
  offer a 'thick description' of the data set.

  Can highlight similarities *and* differences across the data set.

  Can generate unanticipated insights.

  Allows for social as well as psychological interpretations of data.

  Can be useful for producing qualitative analyses suited to informing
  policy development.
