## Under the umbrella quote of "Don't program blind" -- tools that help theprogrammer see what he's doing:

### [Don't Learn to Code, Learn to Program]

Quite a sad title really. And sad content. BUT it does link to some wise words
from Jeff Atwood, Peter Norvig ("Learn to program in 10 years!"), and has a
handful of links to different projects and a nice quote:

    If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the
    first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.

        -- Gerald M. Weinberg, The Psychology of Computer Programming (1971)


### [Out in the open: These Hackers want to give you Superpowers]

"We consider programming a modern-day superpower. You can create something out
of nothing, cure cancer, build billion-dollar companies," he says.  "Weâ€™re
looking at how we can give that super power to everyone else."
    

    The problem with coding, he says, is that you can't see the results of your
    work until after you're done. In that sense, programming is unlike almost
    every other craft. "When a chef adds an ingredient, he can smell it, he can
    taste it," Granger says. "When an artist makes a stroke on a canvas, he can
    see it. But programming isn't that way." 
    
        -- Chris Granger
    

Programmers may spend hours or days working on code before they can make sure it
actually works. "We have to play computer in our heads," he says.  "We write
each line, imagine what it will do. You have to act like a computer. The problem
with that is that we're pretty crappy computers." But Light Table seeks to
bridge that gap.


Light Table is an open source programming tool that lets programmers see the
results of their code as their write it. It's not an entirely new idea. In the
mid-1960s, an educational tool called Logo gave programming students immediate
feedback. More recently, languages like the kid friendly Scratch and artist
friendly Processing have offered a kind of visual feedback, giving coders more
insight into their programs as they're written.


But applying those ideas to professional software -- complex applications with
thousands or even millions of lines of code -- is another matter. Light Table
tackles such software by not only by displaying the results of the code you're
working on right now, but by showing how it relates to other parts of your
software and how data flow from one chunk of code to another.  It also weaves
documentation throughout the code, while offering new ways to organize and
visualize the code in any application.
