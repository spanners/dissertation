Dear Simon,<br><br>

If you want to take a look at some of the research on regular languages and Algol, go to<br><br>

<a href=http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~gam23/papers.html>http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~gam23/papers.html</a><br><br>

and scroll down to the section "Regular languages and game semantics."<br><br>

There you will find:<br>
<ul>
<li>The first paper we wrote on this, called <a href=ghica-mccusker-icalp2000.pdf>"Reasoning about Idealised Algol using regular languages"</a>
<li>A longer version of that, probably a bit less good, but perhaps containing some better introductory parts, called <a href=ghicamccuskertcs2.pdf>"The regular language
semantics of second-order Idealised Algol"</a>
<li>Some lecture slides on <a href=gamelecture.pdf>game semantics</a> (which is what underlies this work) and the <a href=regexps.pdf>regular language interpretation of programs</a>, which might be accessible but might omit too much background.
</ul>
I think you have already taken a quick look at most of these but anyway, they are a starting point. Feel free to contact me at any point if you want to talk about things, otherwise see you next Wednesday.<br><br>
