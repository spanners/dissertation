Dear Simon,<br><br>

In response to your question on Mathbin (is that visible to the public, by the way?)<br><br>

Ignoring the Gammas for now, the rule says that if you have a command C which contains an undeclared variable iota, you can write<br><br>

new iota in C<br><br>

which is another command in which iota is a declared local variable.<br><br>

[The Gammas just mean that both "C" and "new iota in C" can have other undeclared variables in them, and that there are the same ones in "C" that there are in "new iota in C".]<br><br>

Think of these rules like this:<br><br>

the parts on the left of the turnstile (the |- thing) are the undeclared variables<br><br>

the part on the right is a piece of program text together with its type<br><br>

the rule means "if  you have a program like this (above the line) then you can write a program like this (below the line). They are just saying what programs are well-typed.<br><br>

I hope that makes sense.<br><br>

On another topic, I remembered the other day that my former PhD supervisor wrote a paper that describes the automata-theoretic interpretation of programs, which might be useful as an alternative starting point. You can find it at<br><br>
