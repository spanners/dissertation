<p>Quite a sad title really. And sad content. BUT it does link to some wise words from Jeff Atwood, Peter Norvig (&quot;Learn to program in 10 years!&quot;), and has a handful of links to different projects and a nice quote:</p>
<pre><code>If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the
first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.

    -- Gerald M. Weinberg, The Psychology of Computer Programming (1971)</code></pre>
<h3 id="out-in-the-open-these-hackers-want-to-give-you-superpowers"><a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2014/01/light-table">Out in the open: These Hackers want to give you Superpowers</a></h3>
<p>&quot;We consider programming a modern-day superpower. You can create something out of nothing, cure cancer, build billion-dollar companies,&quot; he says. &quot;Weâ€™re looking at how we can give that super power to everyone else.&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The problem with coding, he says, is that you can&#39;t see the results of your
work until after you&#39;re done. In that sense, programming is unlike almost
every other craft. &quot;When a chef adds an ingredient, he can smell it, he can
taste it,&quot; Granger says. &quot;When an artist makes a stroke on a canvas, he can
see it. But programming isn&#39;t that way.&quot; 

    -- Chris Granger</code></pre>
<p>Programmers may spend hours or days working on code before they can make sure it actually works. &quot;We have to play computer in our heads,&quot; he says. &quot;We write each line, imagine what it will do. You have to act like a computer. The problem with that is that we're pretty crappy computers.&quot; But Light Table seeks to bridge that gap.</p>
<p>Light Table is an open source programming tool that lets programmers see the results of their code as their write it. It's not an entirely new idea. In the mid-1960s, an educational tool called Logo gave programming students immediate feedback. More recently, languages like the kid friendly Scratch and artist friendly Processing have offered a kind of visual feedback, giving coders more insight into their programs as they're written.</p>
<p>But applying those ideas to professional software -- complex applications with thousands or even millions of lines of code -- is another matter. Light Table tackles such software by not only by displaying the results of the code you're working on right now, but by showing how it relates to other parts of your software and how data flow from one chunk of code to another. It also weaves documentation throughout the code, while offering new ways to organize and visualize the code in any application.</p>
